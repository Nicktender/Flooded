# Flooded
Its a mod for Gorilla Tag that lets you flood the map. 

There are some limitations:
1. Basically if the mod is enabled from the haunted menu or Computer Interface and you join a lobby, your game will quit. If it is disabled on both, you will be allowed in publics. (It was not disabling properly when you went into a public :/ )
2. Might not be very preformant, idk tho
