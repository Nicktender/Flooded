# Flooded
Its a mod for Gorilla Tag that lets you flood the map. 

There are some limitations:
1. Basically if the mod is enabled from the haunted menu or Computer Interface and you join a non-modded lobby, your game will quit. If it is disabled on both, you will be allowed in publics. (It was not disabling properly when you went into a public. Don't judge my hacky fixes ok?)
2. Might not be very preformant, idk tho

3. You need to disable and reaenable the mod in the beach map. (its some stupid thing I will fix later)
